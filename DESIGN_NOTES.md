### DESIGN_NOTES

## UX + Design Decisions

- Lightly Branded: Incorporated subtle elements of Seven Seven Sixâ€™s visual language (Inter font, purple action color) without over-branding, keeping it appropriate for internal tooling.
- Notes Field: Allows contextual annotations for each data point.
- Draft Toggle: Enables associates to save incomplete updates without disrupting workflow.
- Status Dropdown: Provides structure to classify the nature of entries, helping teams spot patterns without parsing free-text notes.
- Chart Toggle: Associates can focus on the metrics that matter most to them.

## Visual Voice

I loosely referenced  the Seven Seven Six brand identity based website's spacing and typography, keeping the interface familiar but not over-designed. The goal was to make the tool feel like a natural part of the internal ecosystem.

## Extension Ideas (Out of Scope)##
- Paste-to-Extract for quick metric parsing
